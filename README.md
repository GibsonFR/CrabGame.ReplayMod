A mod to replay your 1v1 match and more!

Go into Practice Mode and type the following commands in the chat box :

  You can control speed by adding an argument after, for exemple : r 10
  
replay cinematic/cine/c -> Starts a replay, e.g. the last recording, in cinematic view 
  You can control speed by adding an argument after pov, for exemple : replay c 0,5 (, and . work)
  
replay pov -> Starts a replay, e.g. the last recording, in Point of View
  You can control speed by adding an argument after pov, for exemple : replay pov 2 
  
replay file 0 -> Starts a replay of a specific file, by default 0 is the most recent, 1 is the second most recent, etc.

replay pause/p -> Pause the current replay, type replay or r to restart

replay stop/s -> Stop the current replay

forcerecord or fr -> Force recording even if its not 1v1 for exemple in practice, wont stop until you type forcerecord or fr again (if you switch map, a different record will be created, but wont stop)



You can find the folder ReplayMod in your CrabGame folder, inside a folder config, you can change somes parameters for the mod, for exemple recordFPS, max numb of files etc...
